# Vizcaya

Built my first fully-responsive hotel website. The website features a navbar, home page, about page, and a contact form page. Grab some features that I think will be useful from bootstrap (navbar/grid). Used some Jquery/Javascript in the end to add the animations. Implemented MapBox GL JS API for map. Animations are from Scroll Reveal (https://github.com/scrollreveal/scrollreveal). Designed and fully coded by me.
